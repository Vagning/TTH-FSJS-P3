# Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 3
This is the Third project of the Full Stack JS Techdegree at Team Treehouse

I decided to keep the form validation in a seperate JavaScript file to make it easier to keep an overview.

Tried to implement some kind of real time validation for the email input field.
